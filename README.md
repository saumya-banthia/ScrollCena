# Scroll Cena!!

Once you install this extension, your scrollbars will be like:

*"**My time's up, your time is now... you can't see me your time's now!!**"*

# Why did I build this?
  - I do not like reading long articles, but I realized that I only notice an article is long when I notice the scrollbar. **That's why that evil thing had to be destroyed!!**
  - Also, built it for lazy people like me who can't find an extension which could insert custom code and have a global and local distinction in its persistence module.
  - Also, I was just bored and thought let's make a Github repo for some reason!

P.S.: If you have a CSS injector of that sort above (or the one's you find in the webstore fulfill your purpose), here's the 3 lines of magic CSS you need to achieve the Scroll Cena effect:

 ```
	::-webkit-scrollbar { 
	    display: none; 
	}
```

# Installation

# Fair Warning
I am no experienced coder and you have now be warned about it, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

PS: I totally forgot to:

-   Put malware or miner into the extension.
-   Add affiliate links in.
-   Connect to external servers to pull other stuff in later.
-   Do logging of any kind.
-   Do any other nasty stuff

What an absolute bummer!
